## Leviathan Axe Combat Tips

### Throw and Roll
_Throw and Roll_ is a technique used to create space. It is executed by **throwing the axe at a more distant opponent** to keep them at bay, and then **rolling away from another opponent** to reposition yourself.

### Throw and Recall
_Throw and Recall_ is a technique that allows you to deal multiple damage to an enemy. To perform this technique, **maintain** your crosshair on one enemy, perform a _**Light Throw**_ using the axe, and then **recall** the axe so that it hits the opponent again as the weapon hurls back towards Kratos.

### Trip Opponents
You can trip opponents by **throwing the axe** at their legs. This will momentarily incapacitate enemies and leave them open to attacks.

### Leave the Axe Frozen in an Enemy

Leave the _Leviathan Axe_ frozen in an enemy after performing a _Heavy Throw_ as this either stuns the enemy or freezes the enemy in place. This techniques allows you to finish off another opponent using the _Blades of Chaos_ or the _Guardian Shield_.

### Stun Heavy-Hitters to Get Inside Heavy-Hitter's Pocket
It is difficult to get inside a heavy-hitter's pocket. We recommend **stunning** the enemy by performing a _Heavy Throw_ using the _Leviathan Axe_; and once the enemy is either stunned or incapcitated, close in on the enemy and start attacking.

### Freeze then Follow Up with Heavy Attack
**Freezing** an opponent by performing a _Heavy Throw_ opens up opporunities to deal damage in different ways. You can follow up with a _Heavy Attack_ and send opponents hurling either into a wall or into other opponents.

## Blades of Chaos Combat Tips

### Sweeping Slash
_Sweeping Slash_ is a technique used to create space. To perform a _Sweeping slash_, **hold R1** when multiple opponents are closing in. This will send enemies reeling back, creating space between Kratos and the enemies.

### Herd Opponents Together
Herd opponents together instead of isolating them. Blades of Chaos gives you enough range to inflict damage to multiple opponents.

### Use on Distant Opponents
You can inflict damage on distant opponents by aiming at them and throwing Blades of Chaos. Likewise, you can bait mobile opponents from a distance and keep throwing the weapon at them.

## Guardian Shield Combat Tips

### Capitalize on Building Up Stun Meter
As Kratos is able to build up an opponent's _Stun Meter_ much more quickly in this type of combat, capitalize on building up the enemy's _Stun Meter_ to make the enemy more vulnerable to your attacks.

### Capitalize on Building Up Rage Meter
As Kratos is able to build up _Rage Meter_ much more quickly in this type of combat, capitalize on building up _Rage Meter_ to give Kratos extra virility in battle.

### Use on Heavily-Armored Opponents
Heavily-armored opponents **cannot** be damaged using neither the _Leviathan Axe_ or _Blades of Chaos_. Your best option is to go bare-handed in _Guardian Shield_ combat.
